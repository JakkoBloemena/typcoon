# Tick ledger

Operational log of ticks (PROTOCOL § The tick). **Every tick opens an entry here —
committed together with its `in_progress` claims, before dispatching — and closes it as
the tick's last act.** Append-only, newest first.

A *stale* OPEN entry (hours old) means the previous tick died: reconcile — check each
claimed id for committed lane output, integrate or revert, flip unfinished claims back
to `open`, close the entry INTERRUPTED — then proceed. A *recent* OPEN entry, or foreign
work with no entry at all, means a live concurrent dispatcher: stop.

Entry format:

```markdown
## Tick <date> #<n> — OPEN | CLOSED | INTERRUPTED
- opened: <local timestamp>
- claimed: <assignment ids set in_progress>
- worktrees: <lane → worktree path; or "main checkout only">
- ids allocated: <any NNN handed to lanes for new artifacts, or "none">
- closed: <local timestamp>
- retro: <one line if the tick stalled, blocked, or died — else "clean">
```
